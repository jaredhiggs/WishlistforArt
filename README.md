# WishlistforArt
This is a first draft of creating a javascript wishlist for art web pages. Have been working together with
<a href="https://www.posterdeli.com">PosterDeli a company who sell art prints</a>. They have helped me trying to perfect exactly how it should be used.

I am only a novis coder and this is the first draft only. So I am pretty sure it's going to need some more work.
